        <!-- History of Blue Monkey Tea Pittsburgh -->
        <div id = "history">
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>The original store was established in May of 2002. It was named Wicks & Beans, as 
                the original merchandise consisted mostly of scented candles and coffee beans. We 
                were located at 2207 Murray Ave, also in Squirrel Hill (down and across from Mineo's 
                Pizza.)

                Despite the small space, we expanded our assortments, eventually also selling teas and 
                international sweets. Well, it was getting tight, so we were very happy to move to a 
                much larger space at 5872 Forbes Ave in July of 2006 and change the name of the 
                store to Margaret's Fine Imports.
                
                Since then we've become mostly a Tea Specialty store with over 400 varieties of teas 
                in stock, and a huge assortment of teapots and tea gadgets. We even sell items like 
                tea cozies and tea wallets!
                
                We offer Tea Classes and Tea Tastings every month. We also carry over 30 types of coffee 
                beans and some neat coffee makers!
                
                Apart from that we also attend to the sweet tooth of our customers by stocking up on 
                international sweets, especially around Holidays.
                
                We offer excellent service and we enjoy interacting with our customers: repeat and new!
                
                On May 9th, 2017 we opened a store in Carnegie and changed both store names to Blue Monkey 
                Tea. The Carnegie PA location moved to Pittsburgh in February of 2019.
                
                Whose a good Blue Monkey Tea? We are a good Blue Monkey Tea! And we are here to serve you! 
                We changed our name, in an attempt, to brand ourselves nationwide.</p>

        <!-- Information about owner of Blue Monkey Tea Pittsburgh -->
        <div id = "owner">
            <h3>Margaret Harris, Owner</h3>
            <p>Margaret Harris is the owner of Blue Monkey Tea, tea & gourmet food store in Pittsburgh, 
                Pennsylvania. As one of Pittsburgh's primary tea experts, Margaret Harris is a tea 
                consultant and regularly conducts classes and workshops on tea at a variety of venues, 
                including colleges, clubs, associations, corporations, and at her store. As a native of 
                Poland, where tea is the primary household beverage, her lifelong experience with tea 
                began quite early: she may have had her first "cup of tea" when she was only one day old! 
                Margaret is a graduate of the Warsaw Medical College, which has enabled her to incorporate 
                her medical knowledge into her teachings on the health aspects of teas and tisanes. 
                Margaret is a founding member of the Western Pennsylvania Tea Business Association, as 
                well as several other business and professional groups.

                Blue Monkey Tea was called Margaret's Fine Imports and before that Wicks and Beans.</p>
